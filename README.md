#  Headline Generation Using NLP (Seq2Seq with Attention)

This project focuses on generating accurate and meaningful **headlines from text documents** using a deep learning-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with attention mechanisms. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook as part of an exam or academic assignment.

## Project Description

Headline generation is a **text summarization** task, often tackled using natural language generation (NLG) methods. The goal is to create a short, readable summary (headline) for a larger body of text, similar to how news websites generate article titles.

We apply:
- Text preprocessing and cleaning (stopword removal, lowercasing, special character filtering)
- Tokenization and padding for fixed-length sequences
- Seq2Seq models (LSTM/GRU-based) with attention
- Training and validation over headline-text pairs
- ROUGE/BLEU evaluation for summarization quality

##  Demo & Sample Results

|  Original Text |  Predicted Headline |
|------------------|----------------------|
| "The stock market saw a significant surge today following the announcement by..." | "stock market surges after announcement" |
| "India's top court has ruled in favor of stricter air pollution laws..." | "court enforces pollution control laws" |

##  Model Architecture

- **Encoder**: LSTM layer to process input text sequence
- **Decoder**: LSTM with attention mechanism
- **Attention Layer**: Helps decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sequence
- **Loss Function**: Categorical crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam

---

##  Dataset

This notebook uses a dataset consisting of:
- **Document-Headline pairs** (e.g., news article body + corresponding title)
- Token-level vocabulary extracted from both input and output

**Preprocessing steps include:**
- Removing stopwords, punctuation, and digits
- Converting to lowercase
- Padding/truncating sequences

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Download the Notebook

```bash
git clone <repo-link>
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk keras tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

Use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to open and run `Headline_Generation_Exam_Notebook_.ipynb`.

## Graphs & Visualizations

###  Training vs Validation Loss

This graph helps track learning progression and detect overfitting.

###  ROUGE Score Distribution

Displays how closely generated headlines match true ones.

###  Attention Visualization (optional)

If attention weights are visualized, you can show which input words influenced each output word.

---

##  Evaluation

Model evaluation is done using:
- **ROUGE-N** and **ROUGE-L** scores
- **BLEU Score** for n-gram similarity
- Manual inspection of generated headlines

---

##  Challenges

- Handling **long input sequences**
- Avoiding **repetitive or incomplete outputs**
- Training time and GPU dependency
- Vocabulary size and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) handling

---

##  Future Work

- Replace LSTM with Transformer models (e.g., BERT2BERT, T5)
- Use pretrained embeddings (GloVe, FastText)
- Beam search decoding for better headline generation
- Serve as an API for real-time headline generation
